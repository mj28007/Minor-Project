Team Members: Bhavya Gupta, Nishtha Kohli, Vanshika Kathuria, Yash Thakran

India's agricultural sector encounters major challenges in optimizing crop selection and predicting yields, essential for ensuring food security and economic stability. This project tackles these issues by applying machine learning algorithms—namely linear regression and random forest—to recommend appropriate crops and predict their yields. Furthermore, Power BI is used for data visualization, which enhances the clarity of the results and provides actionable insights for stakeholders in the agricultural sector.

Methods and Procedures:

1. Data Collection:
The project starts with the extensive collection of agricultural data, including factors such as soil type, climate, historical crop yields, and other relevant parameters. Sources for this data include government records, agricultural websites, and various other resources. The dataset is meticulously curated to ensure it is both representative and reliable.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Extensive preprocessing is carried out to improve the dataset's quality. This process includes addressing missing values and normalizing the data. The dataset is then divided into training and testing sets to support model training and evaluation.

3. Model Selection:
Two machine learning algorithms, linear regression and random forest, are utilized to address the recommendation and prediction tasks. Linear regression acts as a baseline model, offering simplicity and interpretability, while random forest leverages ensemble learning to capture complex relationships within the data.

4. Training and Validation:
The models are trained on historical data spanning from 2000 to 2017, with their performance fine-tuned using validation sets. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting. To gauge their predictive accuracy, the models are evaluated using metrics such as R-squared.

5. Power BI Visualization:
Power BI is used to develop interactive and insightful visualizations that allow stakeholders to explore the data visually. This tool facilitates the identification of patterns and trends through user-friendly dashboards and reports, which help in understanding the model recommendations and yield predictions.

6. Summary of Findings:
The use of linear regression and random forest algorithms produces promising outcomes for crop recommendation and yield prediction. These models demonstrate significant accuracy, with the random forest model proving more effective than linear regression in managing the complexities of agricultural data. The visualizations created with Power BI provide a clear depiction of the factors affecting crop selection and yield, equipping farmers and policymakers with valuable, actionable insights.

"In conclusion, this study introduces a holistic method for crop analysis in Andhra Pradesh, utilizing machine learning methods and data visualization tools. By combining linear regression, random forest, and Power BI, the project establishes a robust framework for informed decision-making in crop planning and resource allocation. The insights gained contribute to the progress of precision agriculture, fostering improved productivity and sustainability in the region."
